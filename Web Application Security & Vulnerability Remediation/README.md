## Project Overview
This project focuses on the security assessment and fortification of a deliberately vulnerable password manager web application, named "Passman". It was developed as part of the Information Systems Security course of the 9th semester at the Electrical and Computer Engineering department of AUTH.

The goal of this project is to apply both offensive and defensive security techniques by:
* Identifying critical web vulnerabilities within the PHP source code and MySQL database.
* Exploiting these vulnerabilities (Proof of Concept) to demonstrate the risks, such as authentication bypass and session hijacking.
* Redesigning the application's architecture following "Security by Design" principles to remediate all identified flaws.

## Identified Vulnerabilities
During the vulnerability assessment phase, the following critical issues were discovered and exploited:
* **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The login mechanism (`login.php`) constructed database queries using direct string concatenation, allowing authentication bypass using payloads like `xxx' OR 1=1; --`.
* **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The notes/announcements feature (`notes.php`) displayed user input without sanitization, enabling the injection of malicious JavaScript to steal user Session IDs.
* **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information:** User login credentials and third-party website passwords were saved in the database without any cryptographic protection.
* **Unencrypted Network Traffic:** The application transmitted sensitive data over HTTP, allowing interception via network sniffing tools.

## Implemented Solutions
To secure the application against the aforementioned threats, the following defensive mechanisms were implemented:
* **Prepared Statements:** Eliminated SQLi vulnerabilities by replacing dynamic queries with parameterized prepared statements (`bind_param`) in login and registration.
* **Password Hashing & Salting:** Replaced cleartext password storage with cryptographic hashing (SHA-256) combined with unique user salts.
* **Symmetric Data Encryption:** Implemented AES-256-GCM encryption using PHP's OpenSSL library to securely store third-party passwords.
* **Output Encoding:** Mitigated Stored XSS attacks by sanitizing all database outputs rendered in the browser using `htmlspecialchars`.
* **Transport Layer Security (TLS):** Enforced HTTPS (TLSv1.3) communication to encrypt network traffic.

## Technologies Used
* **Backend:** PHP
* **Database:** MySQL
* **Environment:** XAMPP (Apache Web Server)
* **Security Testing Tools:** Wireshark, HeidiSQL

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/geotsad/Academic-Projects.git](https://github.com/geotsad/Academic-Projects.git)

2. Move the passman project folder into the htdocs directory of your XAMPP installation.

3. Start the Apache and MySQL modules from the XAMPP Control Panel.

4. Import the provided database schema (pwd_mgr) into MySQL using HeidiSQL or phpMyAdmin.

5. Access the application via your browser at https://localhost/passman/index.html (Ensure SSL is configured for HTTPS).
