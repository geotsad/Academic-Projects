## Introduction

Welcome to the Snakes and Ladders Project in Java. This project is an implementation of the Snakes and Ladders board game, developed as part of a Data Structures course 
assignment in the 3rd semester of my university studies.  The game is designed for two players, who roll a die and move across a board while encountering snakes, ladders, 
and gifts. The first player to reach the final tile wins. The project follows an object-oriented approach, using multiple classes to represent game components such as the 
board, players, snakes, ladders, and gifts.


## How it is played

1. **Board Setup**: The board is created with dimensions NxM, containing a set number of snakes, ladders, and gifts placed randomly.
   
2. **Turn Order**: Players roll a die, and the one with the lowest number starts first.
   
2. **Movement**:
-The player moves forward based on the die roll.
-Landing on a ladder base moves the player up.
-Landing on a snake head moves the player down.
-Landing on a gift tile may increase or decrease the player's score.

4. **Winning Condition**: The first player to reach the last tile wins the game.


## Usage 

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. **Download the project files**:  
   Clone the repository or download the project files into a folder on your computer.

2. **Open the project in an IDE**:  
   - Use a Java IDE such as Eclipse (the one that I used), VSCode, JetBrains.
   - Open the IDE and load all the project files into the appropriate folder, or create a new project and add the files manually.

3. **Compile and run the program**:  
   - Compile (build) the program using the IDE.  
   - Once the compilation is successful, run the program directly from the IDE.
